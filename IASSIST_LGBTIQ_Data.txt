The report elaborates on the key findings and lessons from these pilots, as well as recommendations for scaling up safe data collection and use, to advance the inclusive development of LGBTI+ people and ensure that no one is left behind.In terms of content, the index indicators include two kinds of measures. The first assesses opportunities open to LGBTI people, which are defined by the presence of laws that exist to promote equal access to education, jobs and health care, for example. While measures of legal rights are also used in some other indexes, the LGBTI Inclusion Index extends beyond rights to assess how LGBTI people live. This second set of measures focuses on outcomes that reflect the lived experience of LGBTI people in each dimension, such as levels of poverty and educational attainment.

Accessing HIV post-exposure prophylaxis: gay and bisexual men in the UK describe their experiences	https://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-852745	Dataset	Dodds, C., Keogh, P., Weatherburn, P. (2017).

SN: 852745, DOI: 10.5255/UKDA-SN-852745	2017	2005	2005		UK Data Archive	This qualitative investigation sought to describe and examineo Gay and Bisexual men’s experiences of trying to access post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (PEP) in England and Wales, following a series of information campaigns in 2004/5. The sample was drawn from those men who had participated in the annual Gay Men’s Sex Survey by Sigma Research, and who had indicated an interest in talking about their experiences of trying to access PEP after completing the survey online in 2005. Thirty men were interviewed by telephone about the specific circumstances that led them to seek PEP, how they knew about it, what they did before asking for it, and a detailed account of what happened when they presented for PEP in a clinical setting. Thematic analysis of these individual accounts offers detailed insights into the different ways that men come to know about PEP and seek support following risk incidents, as well as revealing the disparities in service provision across England and Wales. Not all of the men who received PEP reported satisfactory experiences with health care and reception staff, and some were inappropriately refused treatment, or attended clinics where staff were unaware of the existence of PEP.

African attitudes toward same-sex relationships, 1982–2018 	https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.1787	Journal Article	Dionne, K., & Dulani, B.  (2020, December 17). African Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Relationships, 1982–2018. Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Politics. Retrieved 21 May. 2025, from https://oxfordre.com/politics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-1787. 	2020				Oxford University Press	One significant barrier to sexual minority rights in Africa is the generally negative attitudes ordinary Africans have toward same-sex relationships. Yet since 1998, there has been notable progress in terms of legalizing same-sex relationships on the continent, with Botswana the most recent African country to do so, in 2019. Botswana joins Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, Lesotho, Mozambique, São Tomé and Príncipe, Seychelles, and South Africa, among countries that have decriminalized same-sex relationships. Publicly available cross-national survey data measuring citizen’s attitudes toward homosexuality in 41 African countries from 1982 to 2018 shows that, on average, Africans hold negative attitudes toward same-sex relationships, which is consistent with previous reports. However, there is variation in these attitudes, suggesting greater tolerance of sexual minorities among women, people who use the Internet more frequently, and urban residents. One key finding is that homophobia is not universal in Africa. In light of recent policy and legal developments advancing sexual minority rights, and given findings in existing scholarship highlighting the influence politicians have in politicizing homophobia, the literature questioning the generalized notion of a “homophobic Africa” is growing, and there are calls for more research on the factors influencing decriminalization.

The study focused on two research questions:; What does it mean to be asexual for different types of people and how do diverse asexual identities develop over time?; What are the practices of intimacy for asexual people including those in relationships with asexual or sexual partners?; To answer our research questions we conducted biographical narrative interviews, collected solicited diaries and diary-questionnaires. The biographical narrative interviews explored the individual’s experience of being asexual over time; the life events, experiences and relationships that shaped how participants saw themselves and the trajectory of their lives. The participant diaries collected information about the everyday practices of intimacy i.e. the events, experiences, interactions when participants felt close/intimate with someone, a pet or anything else. The third stage of data collection involved a diary-questionnaire that asked participants about their experience of doing the diary. The data was analysed in a number of ways, some of these using the computer software program NVivo 10.; This research was designed in accordance with the British Sociological Association’s ethical code. Participants were given an information sheet detailing the research and were asked to sign a consent form which acknowledged their right to terminate their participation at any point. Participants were also accorded full anonymity with any identifying characteristics removed from their transcripts e.g. names, locations occupations etc."	Qualitative	No		United Kingdom	Northern Europe		Individual	English	Sexuality and Gender Identity, Family and Marriage	social behavior, sexuality, gender identity, asexual, asexual people, sexual orientation, living open and daily life	No		23/05/2025

We did a survey with national representation among 1246 persons in the age 16-80, during April-May 2008. A broad specter of themes was covered by 180 questions. The presented report divides the responses into thirteen themes, mainly based on gender, age, education, city/countryside, religion and degree of support of traditional gender roles. ; The survey was conducted through internet.  ; The survey shows three main trends: ; 1. The majority was neutral or positive in general questions about their opinion on lesbian women and homosexual men. For women there was a great majority, whilst for men a smaller majority. The same situation was also shown for more explicit questions about specific situations and reactions, even though there were tendencies for more negative responses in these cases. In questions about their opinion about lesbians and homosexuals rights to become parents, about one third reported a negative attitude. About one out of five says that they do not know a lesbian women or a homosexual man.; 2. A majority was neutral or positive in general questions about their opinion on bisexual women and men. For women there was a great majority, whilst for men a smaller majority. Around half of the respondents said that they do not know a bisexual woman or man. Transsexuals: a majority was neutral or positive in general questions about their opinion on transgender persons, that is to say a person moving between being a woman and a man. A majority says that they do not know a woman or a man who moves between being a woman and a man. ; 3. Gender differs: more men were negative than women, especially towards homosexual men, bisexual men and male transsexuals, and to give lesbians and homosexuals the same rights to become parents."

Relatively few have never been in contact with lesbian women and homosexual men, and the amount of contact is increasing amongst men compared to before. Fewer men confirmed remarkable negative attitude toward lesbian and homosexuals compared to 2008, whilst women were stable on these matters. A remarkable majority agreed in statements with positive attitude towards lesbian and homosexual persons. There were more negative attitude amongst both women and men towards two women or two men holding hands and kissing, than if there were to person of different sex doing the same. A smaller majority confirmed negative behavior towards lesbian women and homosexual men, normally by jokes. ; The proportion men with negative attitude towards bisexual are lower in 2013 than in 2008, whilst among women it was steady with relatively few. A significant proportion of the population reports that they have never been in contact with bisexual women or men (one fourth, or more). This proportion has been reduced amongst men, but increased amongst women. A minority confirmed negative behavior towards bisexual, but not of serious actions. ; A minority of the population had negative attitude towards transsexuals in 2013, and the proportion was reduced amongst men from 2008. A majority did not have contact with transsexuals, but the proportion that had contact with persons who have had gender affirming medical treatment increased from 2008 to 2013. ; A minority agreed that they expressed evident negative attitude towards transsexuals, more often amongst men than women, while a significant majority said that they agreed in expressing evident positive attitude towards transsexuals. Relatively large proportion were negative to persons who did not suit with any of the regular gender categories showing affection in public. Negative behavior towards transgender was reported by a minority, in most cases by jokes. ;  A relatively large minority supported that persons who had received a gender affirming medical treatment should be able to freeze eggs and sperm in order to be able to be parents to their own children. ; There is a minor unrest in the population regarding how children of lesbian and homosexual parents are. Under half of the men (36 - 40%) and over the half of the women (58->57%) agreed that lesbian couples should have the same right to get assisted fertilization as heterosexual couples, like the law today. At this matter, there were no remarkable changes in mindset de last five years. Amongst women there were a reduced proportion who supported more liberal arrangements regarding egg donation. ; The conclusion were that the last five years has been a movement among Norwegian men towards an accept for lesbians, homosexuals, bisexuals and transsexuals. However, the proportion who confirms negative statements about for lesbians, homosexuals, bisexuals and transsexuals are still evident."

Data for queer lives: How LGBTQ gender and sexuality identities challenge norms of demographics	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053951720933286	Journal Article	Data for queer lives: How LGBTQ gender and sexuality identities challenge norms of demographics	2020	2019				In this article, we argue that dominant norms of demographic data are insufficient for accounting for the complexities that characterize many lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ, or broadly “queer”) lives. Here, we draw from the responses of 178 people who identified as non-heterosexual or non-cisgender to demographic questions we developed regarding gender and sexual orientation. Demographic data commonly imagines identity as fixed, singular, and discrete. However, our findings suggest that, for LGBTQ people, gender and sexual identities are often multiple and in flux. An overwhelming majority of our respondents reported shifting in their understandings of their sexual identities over time. In addition, for many of our respondents, gender identity was made up of overlapping factors, including the relationship between gender and transgender identities. These findings challenge researchers to reconsider how identity is understood as and through data. Drawing from critical data studies, feminist and queer digital media studies, and social justice initiatives like Data for Black Lives, we call for a reimagining of identity-based data as “queer data” or “data for queer lives.” We offer also recommendations for researchers to develop more inclusive survey questions. At the same time, we address the ways that queer perspectives destabilize the underlying logics of data by resisting classification and “capture.” For marginalized people, the stakes of this work extend beyond academia, especially in the era of algorithms and big data when the issue of who is or is not “counted” profoundly affects visibility, access, and power in the digital realm.

Effects of COVID-19 on Livelihood, Health and Psychology of Hijra (Transgender) Population: Insights from Bangladesh	https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-xqs-7r6p	Dataset	"Ridwan Islam Sifat, 2021, ""Effects of COVID-19 on Livelihood, Health and Psychology of Hijra (Transgender) Population: Insights from Bangladesh"", https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-xqs-7r6p, DANS Data Station Social Sciences and Humanities, V1 "	2021	2020	2020	Ridwan Islam Sifat	Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS)	"Background: The COVID-19 lockdown in Bangladesh has left hijra individuals at an increased risk of poverty and food insecurity due to the economic crisis. The lack of healthcare facilities and lack of awareness raises the looming fear of the budding influence of COVID-19 among the hijra population. COVID-19 challenges the fundamental foundation of the public health system, and now the hijra group is out of the system because of stigma and discrimination.; Methods: This article features three Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) conducted by 23 respondents about their experience during the COVID-19 Pandemic.; Objectives: The following research aimed to understand the health, mental stress, social and economic effects on the lives of deprived and marginalized hijra people in Bangladesh of the COVID-19 lockdown. However, in the aftermath of the pandemic, their disadvantaged and socially excluded status makes hijra population more vulnerable to being affected by the virus and facing the economic and social impacts.; Results: The results reflect the effect of COVID-19 in terms of social, health care and mental health problems on the hijra community in Bangladesh.; Conclusion: The conclusion also presents valuable recommendations for policy practitioners during the COVID-19 situation to support the hijra community. Hijra people are assumed to suffer under the severity of the pandemic even more than the general population due to the intersections between their status as a vulnerable social group, and their high amount of medical risk factors. The COVID-19 pandemic can potentiate these vulnerabilities, add new challenges for hijra individuals, leading to devastating consequences, like severe physical, and mental health issues."

Enquête Gai Pied Hebdo 1985. Gay Survey	https://doi.org/10.21410/7E4/OCKOUI	Dataset		2020	1985	1985	Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS)	Sciences Po (Centre de données socio-politiques CDSP)	In 1985, Michael Pollak initiated a research programme on the impact of AIDS on bisexual and homosexual people. At the time, the latter accounted for half of the AIDS cases recorded in France, hence the advantage of collecting information on their lifestyles in order to develop prevention measures specific to them. From 1992, following the death of Michael Pollack, it was his assistant, Marie-Ange Schiltz, who headed the survey. It is important to note that it is always hard to study a minority social group, because one generally encounters problems of representativeness and sample size. At the time, homosexuals as a social group were a stigmatised minority, for whom criteria of belonging were not visible. These difficulties explain the decision to conduct repeated surveys, distributed through the press, which made it possible to recruit a large number of respondents quickly and at relatively little cost. This research focused on studying two distinct, but intimately linked problems: the management of a socially frowned upon sexual identity, and anxiety over the health risk, which was reinforced by medical powerlessness. Indeed, at the time, the perception of a deviancy linked with sexual orientation combined with the experience of seropositivity and stigmatisation that could be linked with it. In order to design and assess a policy of prevention appropriate to male bisexuals and homosexuals, it was necessary to find out about the sexual practices and social representations of that population. The Gai Pied Hebdo surveys, and then the Presse Gaie surveys, form the central component of this research programme. In 1993, the topics covered included the diversity of homosexual and bisexual lifestyles, and the level of tolerance among heterosexuals towards homosexuals. In addition, the questionnaire raised the issue of rationalising sexual behaviours in order to reduce the risk of infection by the AIDS virus. The survey also sought to analyse the spread of “safer sex” among homosexuals.

Laws and regulations that discriminate against sexual and gender minorities not only impede social and economic prosperity for the individuals concerned, but can limit a country’s wider economic prosperity and development. The EQOSOGI data in this dataset were collected in 2020 in 16 pilot countries covering a range of World Bank regions and income groups. The second round of data will be collected in 2023 and include the 16 original countries and add data for an additional 46 countries. The EQOSOGI project aims to continue expanding its dataset to more countries in the future and also set up a historical data panel showing the path of reform over multiple years. As the dataset grows, it will allow for simple correlation analysis to compare the EQOSOGI data on laws and regulations with measures of economic growth and prosperity. ; Data are collected across six dimensions (“indicator sets”) which consist of questions on various aspects of the law that are scored based on Yes/No answers. Scoring and further methodological details can be found in the cover page (first sheet) of the dataset. The six aforementioned indicator sets are: Criminalization and SOGI; Access to inclusive education; Access to the labor market; Access to public services and social protection; Civil and political inclusion; Protection from hate crimes. These six indicator sets aim to cover laws and regulations giving rise to or prohibiting discriminatory treatment on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and/or sex characteristics as well as policies and other enforcement mechanisms that implement existing antidiscrimination laws."

This discrimination and violence lead to exclusion, which adversely impacts their lives, as well as the communities and economies in which they live. A major barrier to addressing this stigma and sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI)-based exclusion is the lack of SOGI-specific data. Robust, quantitative data on differential development experiences and outcomes of sexual and gender minorities—especially those in developing countries—is extremely thin. is paucity of data jeopardizes the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and countries' commitment to the principle of 'leaving no one behind' in the effort to end poverty and inequality. Equality of Opportunity for Sexual and Gender Minorities assesses the unique challenges that sexual and gender minorities face in six important areas: Criminalization and SOGI, Access to education, Access to the labor market, Access to public services and social protection, Civil and political inclusion, Protection from hate crimes. This report offers numerous policy recommendations to prevent and eliminate discriminatory practices in all of the areas covered. It also seeks to influence legislative changes and support research on institutions and regulations that can ultimately lead to poverty reduction and shared prosperity. At the same time, it acknowledges that the mere existence of inclusive laws and regulations does not ensure that sexual and gender minorities are free from discrimination—the enforcement of those laws is crucial. This publication, the first in a series of studies, will be expanded from the 16 countries included to a wider set of countries for more in-depth quantitative analysis and to identify possible correlations with socioeconomic outcomes. It will seek to deepen knowledge, facilitate peer learning of good practices, and encourage reforms to increase the inclusion of sexual and gender 				Mexico, Uruguay, Japan, Bangladesh, Costa Rica, South Africa, Indonesia, Lebanon, Jamaica, Nigeria, India, Mozambique, Tunisia, Canada, Ukraine, Kosovo	Northern America, Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia, Europe, Africa, Americas			English	Sexuality and Gender Identity, Socio-economic-cultural, Law and Policy, Criminal Justice, Discrimination	law and legislation, gender expression, discrimination, transgender people, gender roles, social exclusion, economics, gender identity, bisexuals, sexual minorities, sexual orientation, hate crimes, education	No	There is a dataset entry	21/05/2025

It is the first ever EU-wide online survey to establish an overview concerning the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people (18 years or older) and their experiences with regard to fundamental rights in the 28 EU Member States. Up until now, there has been very little comparable data collected across the EU about the everyday experiences of LGBT people with respect to discrimination, and lot of the available information is limited to occasional news reports and court judgements. As the first EU-wide survey of its kind, the results support the development of equal treatment policies for LGBT people in the European Union and set the agenda for years to come. Based on the survey results, national and European policy makers, as well as non-governmental organisations, are able to better target their advocacy strategies and activities to support LGBT communities to live and express themselves freely in a non-discriminatory environment. The survey was completely anonymous (no additional data on the participants and their sessions were logged in any way). The survey data collection operated by Gallup Europe, a professional survey and consultancy firm. In order to ensure that the survey delivers evidence needed for policy making, the EU LGBT Survey counted on the participation of a large and diverse group of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people from each country. Hence, it was vitally important for the success of the survey that FRA and Gallup worked together with civil society organisations to reach a wide audience and raise awareness concerning the survey, including participants emailing the survey, sharing it through social media or simply inviting LGBT friends to take part.

The aim of the study was to collect first systematic data on everyday life of gays and lesbians, who represent a hard-to-reach or a hidden social minority. The aim was to find out, which are the social-demographic characteristics of this population and what are the problems they are facing with in everyday life due to their sexual orientation. The research was based on findings from other (foreign) studies and from theoretical references from the fields of sociology, lgbt studies, and gender and sexuality studies. The research attention was put on broader social circumstances and characteristics of late modern Western societies (e.g. reflexive individualism, transformation of intimacy, family changes, changes in parenting etc.) as well as on specificities of the population of gays and lesbians that are results of heteronormative social context (social exclusion, discrimination, violence etc.). The study included various topics that were identified as crucial in everyday life of gays and lesbians (coming out in various social settings, such as friendship networks, parents and family, school, working place, public spaces etc., experiences of violence due to sexual orientation, intimate partnerships, family etc.). Research was carried out with a combination of quantitative (survey) and qualitative (focus groups) research methods. Due to sensitivity of the data, only survey data is available at the ADP."

However, despite this growing literature, there has been no dedicated research on those who are the abusive partners in same-sex, bisexual and/or trans relationships, and consequently there has been little evidence to inform the development of services to address their behaviours. This study, which we have named the Coral Project, is the first UK study to collect data specifically about the perpetration of violent and abusive behaviours in lesbian, gay, bisexual and/or transgender (LGB and/or T) relationships.; The aims of the Coral Project were to: explore similarities and differences across sexuality and gender of those who enact ‘abusive’ behaviours in LGB and/or T and heterosexual relationships; do this with those who have enacted ‘abusive’ behaviours as well as practitioners who provide interventions for predominantly heterosexual male perpetrators; explore what methods might work best to elicit data to address these aims; and share key findings with key stakeholders to develop best practice guidance for work with those who use ‘abusive’ behaviours in LGBT relationships.; A mixed-methods approach was taken in order to gather both quantitative and qualitative data about the use of abusive behaviours in same-sex, bisexual and/or transgender relationships through a national online survey and follow-up in-depth interviews with volunteers from the survey, respectively. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups with practitioners were also conducted in order to elicit practitioners’ understandings of the use of abusive behaviours within LGB and/or T relationships and their views on the suitability of existing domestic violence perpetrator interventions (designed primarily for heterosexual men) for addressing the abusive behaviour of LGB and/or T individuals, as well as what to find out about the nature of any current provision for LGB and/or T perpetrators and barriers to developing LGB and/or T interventions"	Mixed	No		United Kingdom	Northern Europe		Individual	English	Sexuality and Gender Identity, Family and Marriage	domestic violence, same-sex, gay couples, relationship, lesbians, gay, transgender people, bisexuals, homosexual, sexual behavior, lgbt or lgbti	Yes		23/05/2025

Gay and Lesbian ‘Marriage’: An Exploration of the Meanings and Significance of Legitimating Same Sex Relationships 2003-2006	https://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-5900-1	Dataset	Smart, C., and J. Mason. 2008. “Gay and Lesbian ‘Marriage’: An Exploration of the Meanings and Significance of Legitimating Same Sex Relationships, 2003-2006.” https://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-5900-1.	2008	2003	2006		UK Data Archive	"This qualitative study explores the area of lesbian and gay 'marriage' and civil partnerships. The objective was to examine the socio-legal, cultural and familial meanings and significance for lesbians and gay men of seeking public or formal recognition of relationships. This means examining the kinds of ceremonies couples hold (e.g. with religious elements or not), who they invite (e.g. families of origin or just friends), and whether they follow conventions such as the exchange of rings or whether they adopt radically different styles of ceremony. It also examined how parents and close kin respond to the marriage/registration (e.g. whether there is an exacerbation of or a reduction in feelings of disapproval) and also how the wider kinship network is affected.; Its specific aims were:;     to establish why lesbians and gay men may want to register their partnerships or have commitment ceremonies;     to ascertain how full marriage is regarded;     to identify the kinds of ceremonies that are/will be chosen to celebrate commitment;     to explore what meanings are given to such rituals;     to explore how wider kin respond to the marriage/registration;     to consider how embeddedness (or otherwise) in wider kin networks is influenced by these legitimation ceremonies;     to explore understandings of the legal implications of both partnership registration and of 'real' marriage; The study was based on in-depth interviews with same-sex couples. Fifty-four interviews were conducted: 37 with couples and 17 with individuals, giving a total 91 interviewees. Of these, 61 were women and 30 were men. The majority of interviewees were between 30 and 49 and some couples had been together thirty years or more. All except one respondents described themselves as white (mainly White British, White English, etc.) and the sample was disproportionately 'middle class' (a ratio of 8:1) taking into account factors of education level, the nature of employment and housing tenure. Just under a half (45 per cent) described themselves as having a faith or being part of a particular church congregation. All the respondents had already held some form of commitment ceremony/partnership registration or were planning one in the near future. The study was carried out before Civil Partnership (CP) was legally available so the couples interviewed (with the exception of 4 who had married abroad) were devising their own commitment ceremonies, or registering their relationships with local authorities. Once Civil Partnership was introduced participants were asked if they planned to do this as well and they all intended to do so. Feelings about whether the term marriage should be available to homosexual couples as well as raising questions about why a seemingly heterosexual institution remains important to homosexuals were also subsequently explored.; The interview schedule was open-ended (except for gathering information on basic data like date of birth or occupation) and covered topics from how the couple originally met, the type of ceremony they had organised or were planning, to how their friends and families of origin had reacted to the knowledge of their ceremony.; Respondents were recruited through a number of different sources, the lesbian and gay press, lesbian and gay organisations, and leafleting at gay venues and events. The majority of respondents were part of local networks. Some belonged to local or national lesbian and gay organisations. However, most were not strongly political."

While Africa is often portrayed as a continent of ethnic and religious division and intolerance, findings show high degrees of acceptance of people from different ethnic groups, people of different religions, immigrants, and people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Proximity and frequent contact with different types of people seem to nurture tolerance, as suggested by higher levels of tolerance in more diverse countries and a strong correlation between acceptance of PLWHA and national HIV/AIDS prevalence rates. A major exception to Africa’s high tolerance is its strongly negative attitude toward homosexuals. Even so, while the discourse on homosexuality has often painted Africa as a caricature of homophobia, the data reveal that homophobia is not a universal phenomenon in Africa: At least half of all citizens in four African countries say they would not mind or would welcome having homosexual neighbours.

Intimate migrations: LGBT migrants from Central Eastern Europe and Former Soviet Union in Scotland 2015-2016	https://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-853389	Dataset	Stella, F., Flynn, M. (2019). Intimate migrations: LGBT migrants from Central Eastern Europe and Former Soviet Union in Scotland 2015-2016. [data collection]. UK Data Service. SN: 853389, DOI: 10.5255/UKDA-SN-853389 (not found via keyword search)	2019	2015	2016		UK Data Archive	"Despite a growing body of empirical research focusing on migration and same-sex sexualities, this work has thus far mainly focussed on North America. To date, little empirical research has been conducted on intra-European queer migration, despite very uneven levels of recognition of LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) rights across Europe. This raises questions as to whether transnational migration can be a strategy for enabling non-heteronormative practices and identities, and for accessing sexual citizenship rights.; The project explores how sexuality may shape intra-European migration through a focus on the lived experiences of LGBT migrants who have moved to Scotland from the postsocialist region [Eastern Europe (EE) and the Former Soviet Union (FSU)]. The project's geographical scope is timely, as comparative surveys point to an East/West divide within Europe in terms of policy, legislation and attitudes towards LGBT citizens, with the UK ranked among the most progressive European countries and most countries from the post-socialist region lagging behind (FRA 2013). Moreover, since the mid-2000s the UK has experienced high rates of immigration from the region, with an estimated 653,000 Eastern Europeans settling in the UK in the period 2004-2011 (Vargas-Silva 2013:4).; A focus on Scotland as a migration destination can illuminate broader issues related to UK and intra-European queer migration, whilst also presenting a distinctive case, owing to: i) the significant recent influx of migrants from the post-socialist region to Scotland ii) the higher proportion of European to non-European migrants in Scotland compared to most other UK regions; iii) Scotland's recent shift from a country of emigration to a country with a positive migration balance; iv) Scotland's devolved government and specific demographic and socio-legal context within the UK, despite migration remaining a 'reserved' Westminster matter.; This project provides an in-depth and nuanced exploration of the lived experiences of LGBT migrants, generating significant original data and fresh insights into the role of sexuality in the migration process. The project is interdisciplinary in nature, and draws on empirical, theoretical and methodological insights from sociology, area studies, human geography and anthropology. The research innovatively brings together theoretical frameworks previously used in isolation (intersectionality, transnationalism and personal communities). It combines biographical interviews (phase 1) with visual methods (photo diaries, sociograms) and follow-up interviews (phase 2), in order to capture the complexity of migrants' experiences, multiple belongings and emotional attachments. The research explores how sexuality and gender identity affect reasons for migrating, experiences of migration and plans for long-term settlement. It also contextualises migrants' sense of (dis)comfort, (in)security and belonging within the social networks they cultivate across home and host societies, and considers the role played by sexuality and ethnicity in shaping migrants' 'personal communities' (Pahl and Spencer 2004) and their engagements with them. While foregrounding sexuality and ethnicity, the research will also consider how other factors (such as socio-economic background, gender, nationality, migration status etc) may affect experiences of migration and resettlement.; The research contributes fresh empirical and conceptual insights to topical debates in sexuality and migration studies on the role played by intimacy, emotions and personal communities in shaping migration and resettlement. The research also generated findings and outputs of interest to end users from the public and voluntary sector. This was achieved through a sustained engagement with a range of stakeholders working with LGBT, migrant and minority ethnic communities, or promoting intersectional approaches to equality and diversity agendas."

The research aimed to investigate the protective effects of community involvement in HIV/AIDS and gay-related organizations for HIV/AIDS sexual risk behavior among Latino gay or bisexual men and transgender individuals in Chicago and San Francisco. As part of this, the study examined HIV prevalence and the socioeconomic correlates of HIV infection, sexual risk behaviors, and substance use. Further, the study tested whether community involvement in AIDS and LGBT organizations moderated the relationship of racial and homosexual stigma to sexual risk behavior. Data were collected from a sample of 643 individuals (Chicago: n=320; San Francisco: n=323) through respondent-driven sampling and computer-assisted self-administered interviews. Demographic variables included ethnic identification, sexual identification, ZIP code (only available in restricted use data), country of birth, years in the United States, employment status, income, family religion, age, and health/STD status."

In brief, participants were recruited without explicitly calling attention to their own sexual orientation, but with a number of intentional steps to make the study visible to sexual minorities. The study asked participants a series of questions about issues related to sexuality, gender, and sexual orientation. Most notably, in the middle section of the study, participants were randomly assigned to consider one group in-depth: heterosexual women, heterosexual men, bisexual women, bisexual men, homosexual women, and homosexual men. (The adjective structure was kept consistent for all 6 groups.) Participants responded to a number of attitude and belief items about their assigned target group, including beliefs about the controllability and stability of the group's sexual orientation and guesses about the personality characteristics of group members.

By means of a survey of a random sample of 500 LGBs and a similar number of heterosexual employees, the study will describe and quantify experiences, examine how experiences vary between lesbians, gays and bisexuals, and how they differ from those of heterosexuals. Factors which may contribute to negative experiences, eg gender, age, ethnicity, disability, levels of education, pay, tenure, organisational status and occupation will be explored. The survey will be followed up by six organisational case studies, two each from the public, private and third sectors, respectively representing a high and a low risk organisation in terms of discrimination, bullying and harassment. In addition to investigating various risk-factors, the case studies will explore how LGBs describe and make sense of their working experiences with a particular focus on LGBs’ level of openness about their sexuality in the workplace. Information about how actions by management, trade unions/staff associations and other players might impact on disclosure and experience of discrimination, bullying and harassment will also be sought.

This project addresses social exclusion, not only through identifying exclusions, but also by exploring how life might become liveable in everyday places in two very different contexts.; In 2013 the Marriage (Same Sex) Act passed in the UK, and in India the Delhi High Court's reading down Indian Penal Code 377 in 2009 to decriminalize sexual acts between consenting same-sex people was overturned by the Supreme Court. Yet bullying, mental health and safety continue to be crucial to understanding British LGBTQ lives, in contrast the overturned the revoke of Penal Code 377 2013, this has resulted in increased visibilities of LGBTQ people. These different contexts are used to explore liveable lives as more than lives that are just 'bearable' and moves beyond norms of happiness and wellbeing.; This research refuses to be fixed to understanding social liberations through the exclusion/inclusion, in place/out of place dichotomies. Using commonplace to move beyond 'in place' towards being common to the place itself. Place can then be shared in common as well as collectively made in ways that do not necessarily impose normative agendas/regulatory conditionalities. Social liberations are examined in the transformation of everyday encounters without conforming to hegemonies or making 'normal' our own.; Whilst the focus is sexual and gender liberations, the project will enable considerations of others social differences. It will show how places produce differential liveabilities both where legislative change has been achieved and where it has just been repealed.

Although there has been a considerable amount of research into understanding domestic arrangements within heterosexual households, this is not the case for same-sex households. In particular, little or no research has been carried out on money management in same-sex households. The study intended to address this gap and to develop a more complete understanding of domestic economies in today’s society.; The main aims of Money Management in Lesbian and Gay Couples, 2004-2006 were to investigate:;     how same-sex couples manage their finances;     potential links between money management practices and relationship beliefs;     how money management in same-sex couples compares with heterosexual couples;     views on civil partnership legislation; The study comprised qualitative in-depth interviews and a quantitative survey which looked at financial practices, relationships and civil partnership beliefs in lesbians and gay men. The qualitative interviews are not available for secondary analysis due to confidentially reasons.

[data collection]. UK Data Service. SN: 4476, http://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-4476-1	2002	1987	1994		UK Data Archive	"The SIGMA project research had its origins in 1982 at University College Cardiff, as a project to investigate gay and bisexual men's sexual behaviour as AIDS began to threaten (then GRID: gay-related immune deficiency). Following extensive piloting, the main SIGMA study was launched in 1986 and between 1987 and 1994 carried out a seven-year, five-phase cohort study of gay and bisexual men. The main aims of the study were to estimate, in a natural (non-clinic based) sample: (1) the prevalence and incidence of sexual behaviours (especially those implicated in the transmission of HIV), (2) to take blood-samples to investigate rates of HIV sero-positivity and sero-conversion, (3) to examine the social and sexual lifestyles and culture of gay and bisexual men, and (4) to monitor the trends towards safer sex practice, especially the adoption of condoms.; As a longitudinal study, there was a major focus on change in these processes. SIGMA was one of the largest studies of gay and bisexual men in the world, was an integral part of the WHO (Global Programme on AIDS) Seven-Nation Homosexual Response Studies and shared research instruments with a number of US and European projects.; A component part of SIGMA data consists of 1,975 month-long sexual diaries. The Diaries Project asked gay and bisexual men to keep diaries, filled in on a daily basis usually over a period of a maximum of one month, giving detailed information about the content and sequence of their sexual activity, about their partners' characteristics and about the context in which the sexual behaviour occurred. Diarists were recruited both as part of the Project SIGMA ongoing samples, supplemented occasionally by large-scale appeals in the gay press for volunteers. The 774 diaries have now been anonymised, microfiched and indexed. the machine-readable coded versions are lodged in this dataset. The natural-language microfiched and anonymised versions are not held at the UK Data Archive, but at the Wellcome Library for the History and Understanding of Medicine, Archives and Manuscripts, The Wellcome Trust, London; see the Wellcome Trust Investigating responses to AIDS in the late 1980s blog page for further details and how to apply for access.; Main topics; Each wave has a core and non-core component, the core component always covers: phlebotomy (actual blood test); SIGMA type (age-group by relationship status); current sexual orientation; sexual acts inventory; relationships and history; regular, occasional and casual sex activity; un/safe and risk behaviour; health and lifestyle; DAS (Leeds depression, anxiety, stigma) scale; (reported) HIV testing; 1-week retrospective sexual diary.; The non-core component covers:;     Wave 1 (1987/88) current demographic details; the past (sexual and orientational history, coming out, sexual relationship/s); sexual practices (including age at first homosexual (and heterosexual) experiences, timing and numbers of subsequent sexual experience and casual and regular partners; genitalia; 1-week diary; health Leeds DAS scale; suicidal feelings/incidents; HIV test; STIs, 'safer sex' practices, beliefs; condom usage; aids knowledge and networks; regime and lifestyle; recreational drugs; health beliefs.;     Wave 2 (1988/89) included: disclosure; social networks; sexual partners; communication and norms; subjective estimates of risk; SM sex, supplement for HIV sero-positives.;     Wave 3 (1989/90) included: relationship history chart; household arrangements; sex for money; verbal and physical abuse; (sero-positive supplement).;     Wave 4 (1991/2) included: condom use; meaning of words describing sexual behaviour; clinic attendance; (new respondent supplement) (sero-positive supplement).;     Wave 5 (1993/4) included: believed HIV status; sexual health publicity campaigns (sero-positive supplement).; Standard Measures:; DAS (Leeds Depression, Anxiety Scale) Hamilton 1960; Snaith et al 1976); Sexual Acts Inventory (developed by project SIGMA; Coxon 1992); Occupation Code; Socio-Economic Group and Registrar General's Social Class (OPCS, 1980).

The study also explores the impact of various identity characteristics, such as whether an identity is viewed positively or negatively, or whether it is prominent or not to the relationship of stress and mental health outcomes.; The study, using extensive quantitative and some qualitative measures, is a longitudinal survey of 525 men and women between the ages 18 and 59 who are residents of New York City. Socio-demographic information collected about respondents included age, education, race and Hispanic ethnicity, adopting the measures developed and used by the United States Census Bureau in the United States population survey of 2000. In addition to these items, racial/ethnic identity was also assessed with the question ""What is the country of origin related to your or your family's ethnic or national background, if any?"" Respondents were allowed to select up to two nations from a comprehensive listing. For the purposes of the study, the instrument also assessed whether or not participants were natives of New York City or migrated as adults.

The author shows us how current data practices reflect an incomplete account of LGBTQ lives and helps us understand how data biases are used to delegitimise the everyday experiences of queer people.; Guyan demonstrates why it is important to understand, collect and analyse queer data, the benefits and challenges involved in doing so, and how we might better use queer data in our work. Arming us with the tools for action, this book shows how greater knowledge about queer identities is instrumental in informing decisions about resource allocation, changes to legislation, access to services, representation and visibility."

Emily Drabinski.The Library Quarterly 2013 83:2, 94-111       	2013			Drabinski Emily	The Library Quarterly, The University of Chicago Press	Critiques of hegemonic library classification structures and controlled vocabularies have a rich history in information studies. This project has pointed out the trouble with classification and cataloging decisions that are framed as objective and neutral but are always ideological and worked to correct bias in library structures. Viewing knowledge organization systems from a queer perspective, however, challenges the idea that classification and subject language can ever be finally corrected. Engaging queer theory and library classification and cataloging together requires new ways of thinking about how to be ethically and politically engaged on behalf of marginal knowledge formations and identities who quite reasonably expect to be able to locate themselves in the library. Queer theory invites a shift in responsibility from catalogers, positioned to offer functional solutions, to public services librarians, who can teach patrons to dialogically engage the catalog as a complex and biased text, just as critical catalogers do.

Key objectives were to explore (a) how effective the legislation was perceived to have been in terms of increasing the sense of social inclusion amongst same-sex couples and reducing discrimination; (b) the views of same-sex couples about the involvement of the state in defining their relationship since the implementation of the legislation. Participants were purposively selected in order to create a diverse sample according to partnership status or intentions in relation to civil partnership; gender; age; parental status; ethnicity; socio-economic status; and geographical location. All those included had at least two years’ experience of being a couple in order to ensure that discussion of circumstances and commitment could facilitate consideration of the legal recognition of the relationship or other family commitments. Fieldwork was conducted between June 2007 and January 2008. Verbatim interview data was comprehensively and systematically analysed using the computer-aided qualitative package FrameWork which uses a matrix based format to allow for the thematic and case based interpretation of data. The research showed that the legislation had a number of positive impacts around improving a sense of social inclusion and reducing discrimination but that the legislation also posed a threat to some participants’ sense of social inclusion. Views of couples towards state involvement in their lives differed according to whether they viewed themselves as different and distinctive from traditional heterosexual couples. Views varied between civil partnership as: an imposition and regulation; ambivalence and trying to make the legislation work personally within a broad legal framework; welcome of Civil Partnership for its equation with traditional marriage."

At the same time, they also reported pride, receiving support, and participation in organisations and networks. 2) Lesbian women and gay men reported mostly living conditions similar to heterosexual women and men, but were more vulnerable regarding mental health. The analysis indicated few differences between lesbian and heterosexual women. Differences between gay and heterosexual men were also relatively small, but on some parameters gay men reported significantly more challenges in their everyday life. 3) Significantly more bisexual women and men indicated challenges in their everyday life, compared to lesbian women and gay men, and compared to heterosexual women and men. In an equivalent survey from 2013 bisexual women stood out as more vulnerable than the other groups. In the present survey, this was the case also for bisexual men."

SN: 7014, DOI: http://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-7014-1 (NOT found in keyword search)	2013	2008	2008		UK Data Archive	This research project examined the experiences of Irish lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered (LGBT) people living in London. There is a long history of Irish migration to the UK, particularly London. This has coincided historically with many Irish LGBT people feeling compelled to emigrate in search of a more supportive social climate. The appeal of global cities to LGBT people has long been acknowledged. Metropolitan centres are associated with tolerance of sexual diversity and established queer communities. This study will explore Irish queer migrants' reasons for moving to London and experiences there. The research questions will focus on notions of home, identity, belonging, familial relationships and subjectivity. By exploring the relationship between sexuality, ethnicity and diaspora, the study intended to uncover the ways in which contemporary sexual citizenship, migration and queer imaginaries of the metropolis are mutually implicated in complex ways. A qualitative dataset is produced containing interviews with 38 Irish LGBT participants who have been living in London for at least five years. In addition to generating new theoretical work on sexuality and migration, the research findings will be used to inform policy and debate regarding processes of social exclusion.

We imagine a world where all LGBTQ+ people are free to be ourselves and can live our lives to the full. We were founded on 24 May 1989, one year to the day since Section 28 became law. Section 28 of the Local Government Act was a piece of legislation that banned the ‘promotion of homosexuality’ by schools and councils across Britain, and led to a total suppression of LGBTQ+ identities in schools.We have been part of every major fight for LGBTQ+ rights since 1989, including:;     An equal age of consent for gay and bi men;     The end of Section 28 in Scotland, and England and Wales;     Same-sex couples becoming free to adopt children;     LGBTQ+ people becoming free to serve openly in the Armed Forces;     Protection from discrimination at work;     The right for same sex-couples to have civil partnerships;     The right for LGBTQ+ couples to be legally recognised as parents;     The right for same-sex couples to get married;     LGBTQ-inclusive teaching in the national curriculum; Since 2000 we’ve worked with thousands of the UK and the world’s leading employers through our Diversity Champions programme and our Workplace Empowerment programmes. We’re proud to see so many more LGBTQ+ people celebrated and supported at work.; And since 2004, we’ve worked with tens of thousands of teachers and their schools to put the freedom, equity and potential of LGBTQ+ children and young people at the heart of our education system.; And through the Rainbow Laces campaign, which started in 2013, more than a million LGBTQ+ people and allies have laced up to make sport everyone’s game.

For example, if a country passes a new legal gender recognition law based on self-determination, it would receive a point if the law does not require any third party intervention. However, if the law is only available to people over 18, the country would not receive an additional point. Using 32 indicators, we award each country a score.

The economic cost of stigma and the exclusion of LGBT people: a case study of India	https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/527261468035379692/the-economic-cost-of-stigma-and-the-exclusion-of-lgbt-people-a-case-study-of-india	Report							"Human rights and equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people are usually considered through a social, cultural, or ethical lens, but equality and inclusion of LGBT people are also economic development issues. This report develops a model to estimate the economic cost of stigma; negative attitudes toward LGBT people—and the exclusion of LGBT people in social institutions such as education, employment, families, and health care. The model is applied to a case study of India. Three major findings emerge from this report. First, there is clear evidence of stigma and exclusion exists for LGBT people in India. Data on public opinion from 2006 shows that 41 percent of Indians would not want a homosexual neighbor, and 64 percent believe that homosexuality is never justified. Negative attitudes have diminished over time, however. Second, the effects of stigma and exclusion are potentially costly to economies. A conceptual model links exclusion of LGBT people and economic development through (1) lower productivity and lower output as a result of employment discrimination and constraints on labor supply; (2) inefficient investment in human capital because of lower returns to education and discrimination in educational settings; (3) lost output as a result of health disparities that are linked to exclusion; and (4) social and health services required to address the effects of exclusion that might be better spent elsewhere. Third and lastly, in India, existing research does not allow for a precise estimate of the cost of LGBT exclusion, but the cost could be substantial. The loss of labor productivity and output because of employment discrimination and the loss of life years due to early death or disability will reduce the economic output of the Indian economy. With better research on the lived experiences of LGBT people, researchers could use existing analytical tools to estimate the total cost of LGBT exclusion."

In addition, the data were weighted taking into account the respondents’ affiliation with LGBTI organisations and whether they have participated in other LGBTI surveys (including FRA’s LGBT survey of 2012).
